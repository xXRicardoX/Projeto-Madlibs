    madlib = f"A {adj1} glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of \
    dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest {noun1}. The light hit both of their {body_part} \
    at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming {noun2}. Harry heard the high voice \
    shriek as he too {verb_past} his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s {noun3}:\n\
    \"{spell1}!\"\n\
    \"{spell2}!\"\n\
    The bang was like a cannon blast, and the {adj2} flames that erupted between them, \
    at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the \
    {noun_plural} collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s {adj3} jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand \
    fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the \
    head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not {verb}, who had \
    come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of a Seeker, \
    caught the {noun4} in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils \
    of the {adj4} {body_part2} rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body \
    feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort \
    was dead, {verb_past2} by his own rebounding {noun5}, and Harry stood with two wands in his hands, \
    staring down at his enemy’s {noun6}."
